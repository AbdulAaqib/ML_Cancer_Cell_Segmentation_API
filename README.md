# ML_Cancer_Cell_Segmentation_API


•	Developed a CNN-based machine learning cancer cell segmentation model achieving a remarkable accuracy of 99.12%.
•	Implemented the model using the TensorFlow framework and trained it with predetermined cancer weights to optimize performance. Created a Cancer Segmentation API using Python, TensorFlow, and FastAPI, and deployed it on Heroku for accessibility.
•	Demonstrated the potential of AI in medical imaging for accelerating cancer tumour detection. 
•	Leveraged expertise in CNN, deep learning frameworks, and deployment tools to deliver a robust solution for cancer segmentation and detection.	
•	Made use of Git version control to keep track of every modification to the code.
